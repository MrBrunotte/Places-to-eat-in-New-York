# Vacation Explorer

Vacation explorer makes recommendations to the user based on the chosen city. It can be used to find hotels, restaurants and bars in the chosen city. The user can also scroll on the map to find other locations in the city, this is done by scrolling to the new location and then clicking on one of the three buttons to get the disired recommendations.

The webpage is simple and intuiative for the user to use, the intention is to have a clean and simple layout so that the user will not be confused and not know what to do when visiting the page.

## UX

This website is for anyone who thinks of traveling to another city and want some ideas to find hotels, restaurants and bars in the city! The website gives the user a quick and easy access to these three catagories in the chosen city. The webpage has a simple layout so that the user quickly can get an overview if the city has anything to offer them.

The typical user is person or family that haven't decided on where they want to go for a vacation. They want a simple first look at their destination.

### Fonts

I have used two different fonts from Google fonts to create a typographic harmony.
I used the Roboto Condensed fonts for the headings (h1 and h2) and it is pared with the Oswald fonts for the body text.

1) Roboto Condensed [RobotoCondensed](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Oswald|Roboto+Condensed&query=roboto+condensed)
2) Oswald [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Oswald|Roboto+Condensed&query=oswald)
