# Vacation Explorer

Vacation explorer makes recommendations to the user based on the chosen city. It can be used to find hotels, restaurants and what to do in a particular city.
This is a webpage that is simple and intuiative for the user to use, the intention is to have a clean and simple layout so that the user will not be confused and not know what to do when visiting the page.

## UX

This website is for anyone who thinks of traveling to another city and want some ideas of where to stay, eat and do! The website gives the user a quick and easy access to these three catagories in the chosen city. The webpage has a simple layout so that the user quickly can get an overview if the city has anything to offer them.

The typical user is person or family that haven't decided on where they want to go for a vacation. They want a simple first look at the destination.
