# Vacation Explorer

Vacation explorer makes recommendations to the user based on the chosen city. It can be used to find hotels, restaurants and what to do in a particular city.
This is a webpage that is simple and intuiative for the user to use, the intention is to have a clean and simple layout so that the user will not be confused and not know what to do when visiting the page.

## UX

This website is for anyone who thinks of traveling to another city and want some ideas of where to stay, eat and do! The website gives the user a quick and easy access to these three catagories in the chosen city. The webpage has a simple layout so that the user quickly can get an overview if the city has anything to offer them.

The typical user is person or family that haven't decided on where they want to go for a vacation. They want a simple first look at the destination.

### Fonts

I have used two different fonts from Google fonts to create a typographic harmony.
I used the Roboto Condensed fonts for the headings and it is pared with the Oswald fonts for the body text.

[GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

1) Roboto Condensed [RobotoCondensed](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Oswald|Roboto+Condensed&query=roboto+condensed)
2) Oswald [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Oswald|Roboto+Condensed&query=oswald)

### Wireframe and Mockup

The wireframe displays my sites structure both on a smartphone and on a desktop, the mockup shows the static visual design draft. In the mockup you can see the colors and typography etc of the page.

The wireframe and mockup was made with [AdobeXd](https://www.adobe.com/#).
